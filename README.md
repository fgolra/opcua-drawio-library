# OPC UA library for Draw.io

If you want to use this library for developing OPC UA models in draw.io, simply import this library in draw.io by

```File >> Open Library >> "Browse to file OPC-UA-specifications.xml"```

This will create a pellet of OPC UA specifications at the left side, from which you can drag and drop the shapes.

##Note:
Draw.io does not provide double head arrow ends, so "HasTypeDefinition" and "HasSubType" reference types connectors could not be developed.  I have provided two triangles that can be placed on top of the connectors in the final models.
